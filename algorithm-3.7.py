'''
For this lesson, you will come up with your own challenging algorithm 
for other students to trace. It must contain at least 5 if statements 
and use at least one AND or OR boolean condition.

Note: Elif or else statements will not count - 
your statements must be if statements. 
Each if statement should use a unique variable name.
